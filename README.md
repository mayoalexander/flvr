## What is the FREELABEL Network? 

The FREELABEL NETWORK is a streaming Radio, TV, and Magazine publication distributed through a social networking platform where users create accounts, upload various types of media, and showcase their work with the world using their profile and the automated systems.

**SEO URL Redirect Functionality**

For Search Engine Optimization reasons, each post is accesable in a few different ways:

Viewing all of the latest post from a user
* `FREELABEL.NET/@*****USERNAME*****`

Viewing an individual post + all related posts from a user
* `FREELABEL.NET/@*****USERNAME*****/*****TITLE_SLUG*****/`

Viewing an individual post based on absolute Post ID number (Most Secure/Less SEO Friendly)
